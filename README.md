Hello there, this is an example of my implementation for Netty event-driven framework. It might be unusable for the moment 
for your information, this is just a packet-handler with SSL/TLS encryption (To be done). This as far might be replaceable 
with StarGate.

There is nothing much to explain here, I hope you have a good day :)
